# Workout Tracker

This is a workout tracker where users can start a workout and add to it. Using Mongo db and Mongoose schema as well as express, users can add to a workout and complete it. They are able to track the progress and see a snapshot of the last seven workouts.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
